# Why CSS

A little knowledge of CSS makes documentation writting/formatting/publishing much more easier!

Using MS Word is hard because it's not self explainable like CSS, but CSS is also hard to learn because all keywords to remember. but with Developer Tool of Chrome/FireFox, you can learn from example, any website's CSS is accessible and you can pick-up element to see the CSS keywords used, all keywords are also self-explain meaningfull english.

Markdown+CSS is better than MS word on WWW in my opinion.
